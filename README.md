TK

## TODO
- Create an XKCD-style password generator
- Landing page includes a description of your app and what a xkcd password is (assume an unfamiliar audience).
- Form inputs to specify:
	- How many words to use.
	- Whether to include a number.
	- Whether to include a special symbol (for example, @).

## TODO (extra)
- Add more configurations:
	- How many special characters.
	- Spaces or camelCase or hyphens.
	- Max length.
	- All upper case, or all lower case, or make the first letter of each word upper case.
	- Etc...
- Error checking: For example, what happens if a user enters a string instead of an integer for # of words?
- Scrape an online word list to build a really long word list.
