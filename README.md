## Description

XKCD-style password generator

## Outside resources

Word lists are from the [Corpora project](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/)  (CC-0)

## TODO 
- Landing page includes a description of your app and what a xkcd password is (assume an unfamiliar audience).
- ~~Form inputs to specify:~~
	- ~~How many words to use.~~
	- ~~Whether to include a number.~~
	- ~~Whether to include a special symbol (for example, @).~~
- ~~Retain/display form data entered after clicking submit (don't clear fields)~~
- ~~Grab some words to use~~
- Sample output
	- word1-word2-...-wordn#@

## TODO (extra)
- Add more configurations:
	- How many special characters.
	- Spaces or camelCase or hyphens.
	- Max length.
	- All upper case, or all lower case, or make the first letter of each word upper case.
	- choose a word separator (including no separator and random separator)
	- specify min &/or max word length
	- Etc...
- Error checking: For example, what happens if a user enters a string instead of an integer for # of words?
- Scrape an online word list to build a really long word list.
