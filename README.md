## Description

XKCD-style password generator: generates a string of words, plus an optional number and/or symbol, to serve as a more easily memorable password. Takes as inputs a number of words, whether or not to include a number and/or symbol, and a preferred word separator. Options include "memorable mode," which outputs a string consisting of an adjective, noun, verb, and adverb for a "grammatically correct" password, and "dinosaur mode," which outputs a password containing a dinosaur.
